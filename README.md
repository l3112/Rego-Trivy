# Rego-Trivy
Let's finagle with rego and get this Trivy policy up and running!

# End Goal
For the policy to stop buckets being made in an AWS account that do not fit a particular naming scheme.

# Error
`ID002.rego:38: rego_unsafe_var_error: var aws_s3_bucket is unsafe`

## This will probably not be the last error! I'm new at rego. Feel free to watch if you want to help further!
